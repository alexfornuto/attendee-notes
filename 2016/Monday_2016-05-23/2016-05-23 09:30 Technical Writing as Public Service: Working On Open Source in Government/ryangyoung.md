# [Technical Writing as a Public Service](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/speakers/#speaker-britta-gustafson)

Speaker: [Britta Gustafson](https://twitter.com/brittagus)

18F is human-centered, Agile, iterative, and open source (FOSS) and is a part of the Federal Government, specifically the [General Services Adminstration (GSA)](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000).

18F has a team of about 180 people. It's a tiny piece of the government. Part of its mission is to make "of the people, by the people, for the people" more of a reality. Software is a core part f how government works, so the software that government uses should be open, accessible, and modifiable (through pull requests, and within reason). "The people should be able to reuse and adapt the work the public paid for."   

Making government software more accessible and open-source-like, it could attract more participants in the government.

One thing that Britta worked on was [eRegulations](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/eregulations/).

Another was the government's [Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/). Part of this involved writing bug reports on [the White House's GitHub repo](https://github.com/whitehouse/source-code-policy/issues).

Yet another was writing a blog post about the tools that the government, and specifically 18F, uses.

"Public service + open source + documentation = of the people, by the people, for the people"
