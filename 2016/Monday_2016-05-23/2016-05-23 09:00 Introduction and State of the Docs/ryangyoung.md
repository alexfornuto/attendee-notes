# State of the Docs

Speaker: [Eric Holscher](https://twitter.com/ericholscher)

"Documentarian" is the word WTD came up with to define not only technical writers, but also developers, programmers, UX designers, tech support and QA engineers etc etc who contribute to and care about documentation.

Eric envisions a whole series of speakers on different stages talking about the importance of documentation. For instance, he encouraged the crowd to invite people with different job titles to next year's event.

Next year might be split into two different events: one for the east coast and one for the west coast.
