# [Two Great Teams that Work Great Together: Bridging the Gap Between Documentation and Customer Support](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/speakers/#speaker-neal-kaplan)

Neal works at a startup and is the only tech writer. For part of his career, he ran a support group. When "software came in boxes," his doc team was based in Menlo Park and the support team was based in Dublin. The software offered a way to provide customer comments, but the comments were not really cataloged. They were hard to find and often lost.

Documentation should promote "ticket deflection" and be "self-service." Neal feels that "ticket direction" is a better term because interaction with customers is good, as long as that interaction is good.

Neal was at a meetup where a customer support person presented and said, proudly, that they have a knowledge base. A doc person also presented and said they had a help site. The two teams did not share content. The reason for this, they said, was that documentation was "prescriptive" and the support content was "descriptive." This was a bad idea because it forces customers to choose between two sets of information. How are the users expected to know which information to choose? This mentality leads to frustrated customers.

Neal's suggestions:

- Meet your support team. Know who they are and what their expertise is.

- Review support tickets. Especially the tickets that ask how to do something or mention that they've read the docs and still don't understand.

- Set up automated processes. If the support team gets a doc-related ticket, have it automatically assigned to you (or the docs team).

- Review difficult and interesting cases. For example, after talking to an engineer about a difficuly use case, Neal realized that the instructions would benefit from a diagram, which he subsequently added a  diagram.

- Learn about your customers and understand their skill level. Understand their vocabulary. If the terms they're using don't match the docs, maybe you should update your terminology.

- Review ticket metrics. And keep reviewing them. Look for changes.

- Join forces with support! Have one source of truth.

- Have the support team write docs! Give them credit and show them where their efforts ended up.

- Don't train: make templates.

- Make support part of the doc review process.

- Share knowledge. Have the support team come to you with new procedures.

- Use the input from support to reprioritize.
