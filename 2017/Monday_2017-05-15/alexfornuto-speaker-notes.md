# Monday Speaker Notes

## Building Navigation for Your Docs Site

- Tom Johnson

### First realizations of a problem.

User testing for help files - Users struggle to locate the right content.

### New Company... Same Problem

How do you increase the users ability to find answers in Docs?

### Missed Header


#### Action 1: Group topics in product sidebars

** Design principle: Hierarchy**

>Quote from Universal principles of design. 

Heierarchies break down complexity, from a complex system into a list of parts.

Examples of a complex systems, listed into composite parts; philisophical concept, animal kingdoms. 


Heirarchies give a view of the whole

Deep heirarchies don't relay the "whole", stick with a flat hierarchy.

Heirarchies show what's in the neighborhood.

User lands here, looks what's related and may find the topic they're looking for.

### Action 2: Navigate from Docs set to Doc Set.

** Design Principle, Progerssive Disclosure**

>"Strategy for managing information complexity..." -- From Universal principles of Design


Layer Information at different levels. 

Example: Azure docs. 


Example: AWS

### Action 3: Allow Navigation Within Content

** Design principle: Immersion**

>"A state of mental focus to intense that awareness of the 'real' world is lost..." -Quote from Universal Principles of Design.

Even in help, *users want to stay inline*.

Bottom up navigation: Mark Baker list of implementations. **Grab from the slides!**


### Action 4: Make popular topics easy to access.

**Design Principle: Desire Line**

> "Traces of use or wear that indicate the preferred methods of interaction with an object or environment." - Universal Principles of Design

Desire Line Example: Twitter Docs


### Action 5: Reduce information fragmentation

**Design Principle: Modularity**

>"A method of managing system complexity..." Quote from U.P.o.D.

Users read Non-Sequentially - 

>You can just read the sections about the tasks you want to do. - Quote.

Building Blocks != Presentation

### Action 6: Hang signposts along the way.

**Design Principle: Wayfinding**

> "Missed Quote"
