# Monday Speaker Notes

## Building Navigation for Your Docs Site

- Tom Johnson

### First realizations of a problem.

User testing for help files - Users struggle to locate the right content.

### New Company... Same Problem

How do you increase the users ability to find answers in Docs?

### Missed Header


#### Action 1: Group topics in product sidebars

** Design principle: Hierarchy**

>Quote from Universal principles of design. 

Heierarchies break down complexity, from a complex system into a list of parts.

Examples of a complex systems, listed into composite parts; philisophical concept, animal kingdoms. 


Heirarchies give a view of the whole

Deep heirarchies don't relay the "whole", stick with a flat hierarchy.

Heirarchies show what's in the neighborhood.

User lands here, looks what's related and may find the topic they're looking for.

### Action 2: Navigate from Docs set to Doc Set.

** Design Principle, Progerssive Disclosure**

>"Strategy for managing information complexity..." -- From Universal principles of Design


Layer Information at different levels. 

Example: Azure docs. 


Example: AWS

### Action 3: Allow Navigation Within Content

** Design principle: Immersion**

>"A state of mental focus to intense that awareness of the 'real' world is lost..." -Quote from Universal Principles of Design.

Even in help, *users want to stay inline*.

Bottom up navigation: Mark Baker list of implementations. **Grab from the slides!**


### Action 4: Make popular topics easy to access.

**Design Principle: Desire Line**

> "Traces of use or wear that indicate the preferred methods of interaction with an object or environment." - Universal Principles of Design

Desire Line Example: Twitter Docs


### Action 5: Reduce information fragmentation

**Design Principle: Modularity**

>"A method of managing system complexity..." Quote from U.P.o.D.

Users read Non-Sequentially - 

>You can just read the sections about the tasks you want to do. - Quote.

Building Blocks != Presentation

### Action 6: Hang signposts along the way.

**Design Principle: Wayfinding**

> "Missed Quote"


### Design Question

With your own documentationin mind, how are you incorporating some of the following design principles?

 - Heirarchy
 - Progressive Disclosure
 - Immersion
 - Desire Line
 - Modularity
 - Wayfinding

### Overview

Understanding Care + The economic and social impact of care work.

### Who I Am

 - Design researcher and writer
 - previously: human-computer interaction researcher
 - Working in and arounf tech for 10 years
 - primary caregiver for 5


### Understanding Care

** What is Care**

Care is the work of attending to expressed or anticipated needs.

Caring generally takes on three forms: *Industrial, Emotional**, and **Informational**.

###Instrumental Care

Includes activities such as cleaning, helping, shopping.

### Emotional Support

Includes listening, counseling and companionship, **Empathy**.


### Informational

Applying knowledge and best practices. Documentaiton is a form of informational caring.

**Humans Require more care than any other species.**

70% of the pupulation will require long-term care in adulthood.

**Caregiving** is projected to be the largest occupationin the US by 2020. 81% of jobs are in the service sectors.

Care has a global supply chain.

Technology devalues care. We don't think that care is as important as other work.

> Quote from Mark Zuckerburg.

We like to make care invisible.

We like to outsource care.

> Quote from Wired Magazine

### Who is Doing The Care Work?

Cafeteria workers at SilCon Valley Campus attempted to unionize a few years ago.

** Axioms for Care and Technology**

1. Care cannot be automated
2. Care is not a problem to be solved by technology.
3. Pull from Slides

Question: Recall a caring interaction or system that you have experienced recently.

### Care and Documentation

 - How to better understand care in the scope of documentaiton.

#### Case study: Developer tools

**Anti-Patterns**

1. "Roll your own" solution
2. No dedicated resources for documentation = little to no docs
3. Culture that discourages "stupid Questions"
4. "Who is this for?"


** Roll Your Own""

What about Users Who are different than you and your team?

Start with keyboard shortcuts, work from there.

>Quote

**Documentation is everyone's job / no ones job**

Reliance on relationships


Lack of scaffolding for documentation. 


**Fear of Stupid Questions**

The logic of:

> "If I ask for help, or if I make  acase to offer help, I admit vulnerability - AVOID!"

**Who is this for?**


The answer depends on whom you ask.

### Next Steps

**Everyone's Work Is Equally Important**

> Quote from Carol Gillian

#### How do we do better?

**User Research + Docs**

### Storyboard Caring Interactions

Table discussion.
